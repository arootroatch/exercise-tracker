# Exercise Tracker

This is my completed solution to the freeCodeCamp exercise tracker project for the Back End Development certification. 

## Technologies Used
Express, Mongoose, MongoDB Atlas

## Features
- Create new users with form input
- `GET` a list of all users in the database
- `POST` the exercise `description`, `duration`, and `date` to the database for the correct user
-  Retrieve a full exercise log of any user using `GET`
-  Use URL queries to filter the response when getting logs
